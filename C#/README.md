 # Native Library Integration in C#

This repository demonstrates how to integrate a native library written in C/C++ with a C# program. The native library, `NativeLibrary.dll`, contains a function called `hello()` that simply prints a message to the console.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Creating the Native Library

The first step is to create the native library. This can be done using any C/C++ development environment, such as Visual Studio or Xcode.

Here is the code for the `hello()` function in C++:

```c++
#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
    void hello() {
        std::cout << "Hello from the native library!" << std::endl;
    }
}
```

This code simply prints the message "Hello from the native library!" to the console.

### 2. Building the Native Library

Once you have written the code for the native library, you need to build it. This can be done using the build tools provided by your development environment.

For example, in Visual Studio, you can build the native library by selecting the "Build" menu and then clicking on "Build Solution".

### 3. Importing the Native Library in C#

The next step is to import the native library into your C# program. This can be done using the `DllImport` attribute.

Here is an example of how to import the `NativeLibrary.dll` library in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace Program {
    class Program {
        [DllImport("NativeLibrary.dll")]
        public static extern void hello();

        static void Main(string[] args)  {
            hello();
        }
    }
}
```

The `DllImport` attribute specifies the name of the native library and the name of the function that you want to import.

### 4. Calling the Native Function

Once you have imported the native library, you can call the native function from your C# program.

Here is an example of how to call the `hello()` function from C#:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)  {
    hello();
}
```

This code calls the `hello()` function, which prints the message "Hello from the native library!" to the console.
